About The Project

This project is a text-based escape room game implemented in Java. It uses the console as its interface, challenging players to explore different rooms, interact with objects, solve puzzles, and ultimately find a way to escape. The game state is represented through a visual grid-based map, allowing players to see their position relative to objects in the room.

The Problem It Solves

Escape rooms are fun, puzzle-driven experiences, but not everyone has access to a physical one. This project provides a lightweight, digital alternative that players can enjoy with nothing more than a terminal. It’s an accessible way to engage in problem-solving and logical thinking in a low-resource environment.

Why It Exists

The game was created as a learning project to combine fundamental Java programming concepts—such as 2D arrays, loops, conditionals, user input with Scanner, and random number generation—into a cohesive, interactive application. It demonstrates how simple Java constructs can be used to create an engaging, puzzle-driven game.

What Makes It Unique

This project evolves the classic text adventure by incorporating a visual map and a structured puzzle system:

    Grid-Based Visual Map – Players are represented on a 10x10 grid, allowing them to navigate the room visually and understand their proximity to interactive objects like desks, doors, and bookshelves.

    Inventory System – Players collect and use items such as batteries, keys, screwdrivers, and statues to solve puzzles and progress.

    Multiple Puzzle Types – The game features a variety of challenges, including randomized number locks, hard-coded combination locks, clues found on paper, and item-based puzzles like powering a radio.

    Dynamic Environment – The game world responds to player actions. Looking at a desk can reveal hidden locks, and using the correct key will open up new areas to explore.

    Replayability – Key puzzle elements, like the code for the first number lock, are randomized on each playthrough, offering a slightly different experience every time.

This combination of interactive grid-based exploration and puzzle diversity creates a compact but rich escape room experience entirely within the command line.
